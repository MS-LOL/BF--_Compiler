# BF++ Utilities

This is a repo with some tools to ease the pain for those who wish to work in the programming language of BrainFuck (Whoever you are, you must be a masochist)

The Tools included:
* A python Brainfuck++ translator that translates the pseudocode of BrainFuck++ into BrainFuck
* A .xml file containing a User Defined Language for Notepad++ in order to help with syntax highlighting
* A guide for programming in the pseudocode of Brainfuck++

## Brainfuck++ translator

The Following program takes an input of a file that has the file extension of .bfpp and outputs a file with the extension of .bf and contains Brainfuck Code.

## Brainfuck++ User Defined Language

When using the text editor Notepad++, you can import the UDL by navigating to Language/User Defined Language/Define your language... and then pressing Import and selecting the File provided.
If the UDL isn't automatically loading, try restarting Notepad++ and your file should be highlighted. If not, Go into Languages and select the BF++ UDL.

## BrainFuck++ programming guide

A guide on the BrainFuck++ Programming language can be found [here](BrainFuckPlusPlus.md)
